A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

Nowadays, this game is known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, sometimes the rules are different, but the meaning of 
the game remains the same. Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.

Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field where the duel takes place. One of the players plays as 'X', and the other 
player is 'O'. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.

The first player that writes 3 'X' or 3 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
